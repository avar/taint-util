	* META.yml: RT#55666: Don't depend on Taint::Util, resolves a
	circular dependency

	* Util.pm: A new POD section titled "About tainting in Perl"
	inspired by RT#53988. Grammar fixes by Chris Nehren
	* t/usage.t: Skip the qr// test known to fail on <5.6.2
	* t/usage.t: Test for $code and $code->() taintedness
	* Makefile.PL: Removed in the repository in favour of
	Dist::Zilla. This has no effect on users since Dist::Zilla is a
	distro compiler and not a build system.

	* Makefile.PL: Using EU::MM instead of M::I
